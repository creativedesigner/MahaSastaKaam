			<p>A music event is a music oriented event that is sometimes presented with a theme such as musical genre, nationality or locality of musicians, or holiday. During the middle Ages events were often held as competitions.The tradition of music is ages old. Mentions have been made about it in our Vedas. There have been several legends about the development of the Indian music. However, till date the exact origin of Indian music is not really known, but it is definite that singing has been a cultural tradition of the past. Since how long it is being practiced is still a mystery.</p>
			
			<p>In India, music is a way to express the devotion and the unconditional love for God. Several musical festivals are hosted in India to pay homage to those who've contributed in developing, enriching and popularizing the Indian music. Festivals are celebrated as a mark of respect and as a way to acknowledge the great effort made by artists. These festive celebrations provide a platform to all the eminent artists to congregate under one roof and showcase their talent and versatility. </p>
			
			<p>We plan to do four events in a year covering all of India (starting with Delhi). The Music events named Illuminia, Ignitia, Accelia, Jan-sammohan will be held in September, December, March, and July respectively.</p>
